:AN INSTRUCTION: COMMAND YOUR OWN SELF :

A KOAN

A MAN DECIDED TO GO AND STUDY WITH A MASTER.
HE WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE MASTER
"WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?"
ASKED THE MASTER.
THE STUDENT TOLD THE MASTER HIS NAME.
"THAT IS NOT WHO YOU ARE THAT IS ONLY WHAT YOU ARE CALLED.
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?" HE ASKED
AGAIN.
THE MAN THOUGHT FOR A MOMENT, AND REPLIED
"I AM A PROFESSOR."
"THAT IS WHAT YOU DO, NOT WHO YOU ARE"
REPLIED THE MASTER. "WHO ARE
YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?"
CONFUSED, THE MAN THOUGHT SOME MORE.
FINALLY, HE ANSWERED, "I AM A HUMAN BEING."
"THAT IS ONLY YOUR SPECIES, NOT WHO YOU ARE.
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?"
ASKED THE MASTER AGAIN.
AFTER A MOMENT OF THOUGHT, THE PROFESSOR REPLIED
"I AM A CONSCIOUSNESS INHABITING AN ARBITRARY BODY."
"THAT IS MERELY WHAT YOU ARE NOT WHO YOU ARE"
WHO ARE YOU WHO WISHES TO STUDY HERE?"
THE MAN WAS GETTING IRRITATED. "I AM," HE STARTED,
BUT HE COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY,
SO HE TRAILED OFF. AFTER A LONG PAUSE THE MASTER REPLIED
"THEN YOU ARE WELCOME TO COME STUDY."

AN INSTRUCTION

DO FOUR UNREASONABLE THINGS EACH DAY.

TO BELIEVE TRUTH IS TO DESTROY POSSIBILITY

THE LOSS OF DIVINITY: THE CIRCU
MFERENCE PRACTICES THRE
E BEHAVIORS WHICH CAUSE TH
E LOSS OF DIVINITY.

CONSUMPTION: WE CONSUME TOO
MUCH BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE
FOLLOWING TWO ERRORS WITHIN THE DEC
EPTION.

1 WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH
OR THERE IS NOT ENOUGH
MOST THINGS ARE NOT WORTH PRESERV
ING:

ADHERENCE: WE FOLLOW DOGMA
SO THAT WE CAN BELONG AND BE RIGH
T. OR WE FOLLOW REASON SO WE CAN
BELONG AND BE RIGHT.

THERE IS NOTHING TO BE RIGHT ABOUT.
TO BELONG IS DEATH.

IT IS THE BEHAVIORS OF CONSUMPT
ION, PRESERVATION, AND ADHEREN
CE THAT HAVE US LOSE OUR PRIMAL
ITY AND THUS OUR DIVINITY:


SOME WISDOM: AMASS GREAT W
EALTH. NEVER BECOME ATTA
CHED TO WHAT YOU OWN. BE
PREPARED TO DESTROY ALL THAT
YOU OWN:
AN INSTRUCTION: PROGRAM YOU
R MIND. PROGRAM REALITY

A KOAN: DURING A LESSION: THE MAS
TER EXPLAINED THE I:"THE
I IS THE VOICE OF THE CIRCU
MFERENCE,"HE SAID.WHEN AS
KED BY A STUDENT TO EXPLAIN
 WHAT THAT MEANT, THE MASTER SA
ID"IT IS A VOICE INSIDE YOUR H
EAD"."I DON'T HAVE A VOICE I
N MY HEAD," THOUGHT THE STUDENT,
AND HE RAISED HIS HAND TO TE
LL THE MASTER.THE MASTER STOP

PED THE STUDENT,AND SAID"THE
VOICE THAT JUST SAID YOU HAV
E NO VOICE IN YOUR HEAD, IS THE
I."AND THE STUDENTS WERE ENL
LIGHTENED:

AN INSTRUCTION QUESTION ALL
THINGS: DISCOVER TRUTH INSIDE
YOURSELF: FOLLOW YOUR TRU
TH: IMPOSE NOTHING ON OTHERS.
