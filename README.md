This library is very messy and a WIP. Use at your own risk.

The main file to run is `guess_key.py` and pass it a comma-separated list of guesses for keys
`> python scripts/guess_key.py 'CIRCUMFERENCE,PROGRAMYOURMIND,INTERCONNECTEDNESS'`

This will apply several functions to the Unsolved LP and then score the output and show the best matches to real text.
